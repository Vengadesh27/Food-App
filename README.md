# Food Donation App

Hello. This food donation app is my first real project that i did for my final year project using Firebase as the Cloud Database. 
The app has three users: Admin, Donor and Recipient. Admin/Donor can post donations (CRUD), accept
donations & generate report (only admin). Recipients can view and request donations.

## Features of the App
- Allows role based user authentication.
- Uses firebase as a realtime cloud database.
- Donor can add, update, delete, view and approve donations.
- Recipients can only view and request for donations.
- Admin has all functionality of a donor while also being able to generate report.
- The generated report is in tabular format viewed as pdf.
